This folder contain case studies of Marketing Mixed Modeling(MMM) using PyMC.

In the first notebook (mmm_1.ipynb) I studied the case using simple pymc model including the adstock and saturation effects.
Later in the notebook i study the same dataset using pymc-marketing model where its takes into account all 3 effects: adstock, saturation and seasonality.

In the second notebook (mmm_2.ipynb) i use the same model developed in the above to study budget optimization possibilities
